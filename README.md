# Frozen-Lake
Developed the game engine and the RL agent in pure python

## Description

Created the Frozen lake game (Environemnt & Environemnt Model) in pure python

Developed Reinforcement learning agents for the game using the following algorithms:

Tabular Model based algo<br>
1. Policy Iteration<br>
2. Value Iteration<br><br>

Tabular Model free algo<br>
3. SARSA<br>
4. Q-learning<br><br>

Non Tabular Model free algo<br>
5. SARSA using linear function approximation<br>
6. Q-learning using linear function approximation<br><br>

There are duplicates of the same files (in jupyter notebooks and python)<br>
